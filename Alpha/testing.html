      <h3>Color palette</h3>
      <h2>July 11, 2022</h2>
      <p>
        I went to color.cloudflare.design to pick a color palette and came up with the following:<br>
        Parent Color(body): #0C2231<br>
        Color: #D0EDF1<br>
        Background(boxes): #1F567A<br>
        Border: #7CB7DE<br>

      <h3>Second day working on the nav bar</h3>
      <h2>July 10, 2022</h2>
      <p>
        I still feel a little lazy coming back from vacation and only did a little work. I had made a bunch of changes in testing, 
        but it didn't work out so I scrapped it and reverted back to the old one. I had difficulty trying to center the bar at the top
        and making it look more like buttons. I played around with display, width, margin, text-align, top, left, right, bottom, border, but 
        I couldn't get it the way I wanted. I think the answer is to use display: block and then adjusting the borders, but I can't figure 
        out which elements to target. Whether it's nav, ul, li, etc. I'm gonna go back to codecademy and redo some of the CSS courses, 
        then make note of their work with nav bars.

      <h3>Journey</h3>
      <h2>July 9, 2022</h2>
      <p>
        I'm starting this website and blog now because I want to create a portfolio. Although I have been studying Python on and off for the past 2 years, I 
        do not feel competent enough to actually apply for a job. The hospital where I work has nursing informatics positions open that require Python, SQL, 
        and Tableau. I haven't started with Tableau yet, but will probably get around to it within the next year or two. For the time being, I will focus on 
        creating Python projects and developing a website. The plan is to have something up and running by the time I reach my 2 year mark so that I can apply
        for nursing informatics positions internally.

        My first goal is to create a functional navbar, but I'm also playing around with Figma online to try and make a wireframe. I'd like to get the wireframe
        first, but the website requires an artistic touch that I just don't have. Instead, I'm going to work on them simultaneously. Perhaps I can work on the index
        page piece by piece, but I'll eventually make individual, unique pages once I figure out Figma.
