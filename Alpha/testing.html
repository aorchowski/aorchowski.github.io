      <h3>Journey</h3>
      <h2>July 9, 2022</h2>
      <p>
        I'm starting this website and blog now because I want to create a portfolio. Although I have been studying Python on and off for the past 2 years, I 
        do not feel competent enough to actually apply for a job. The hospital where I work has nursing informatics positions open that require Python, SQL, 
        and Tableau. I haven't started with Tableau yet, but will probably get around to it within the next year or two. For the time being, I will focus on 
        creating Python projects and developing a website. The plan is to have something up and running by the time I reach my 2 year mark so that I can apply
        for nursing informatics positions internally.
      </p>

        My first goal is to create a functional navbar, but I'm also playing around with Figma online to try and make a wireframe. I'd like to get the wireframe
        first, but the website requires an artistic touch that I just don't have. Instead, I'm going to work on them simultaneously. Perhaps I can work on the index
        page piece by piece, but I'll eventually make individual, unique pages once I figure out Figma.
